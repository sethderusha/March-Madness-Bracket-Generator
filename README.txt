This is a program that will create March Madness brackets using multiple algorithms including...

1. Random - this creates a fully random bracket where each matchup is decided 50/50/

2. Weighted - this creates a bracket based on seeding. For example in a matchup between a 1 and 16 seed, the 1 seed has a 16/17 chance to win.

3. Historical - this algorithm uses the historical win rates for each seed vs seed matchup. So when a 1 seed faces a 16 seed, the 1 seed has a .987 probability to win.

I have provided a CSV file that represents the 2024 tournament.
To run the program enter this file as an argument.
